# Critical Level Detection

This is study project for course "Parallel Computations" @ Afeka College of Engineering.

The project goal is to detect plane that most hidden from other planes during its flight.
The detection should be efficient and use parallel technologies such OpenMP and MPI.

Full requirements: [][1]

## Implementation Highlights
